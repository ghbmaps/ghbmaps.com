        <p>
          NDVI stands for Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. It is a simple graphical indicator that can be used to
          analyze remote sensing measurements, often from a space platform, assessing whether or not the target being
          observed contains live green vegetation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The NDVI is calculated as follows:
          <br>
          NDVI = (NIR - R) / (NIR + R)
          <br>
          where:
        </p>
        <p id="usgs">
          Landsat 4-5TM C2 L1 | NDVI Calculation (Band 4 - Band 3) / (Band 4 + Band 3)<br>
          Landsat 8 | NDVI Calculation (Band 5 - Band 4) / (Band 5 + Band 4)
        </p>
        <p>
          NIR is the near-infrared reflectance
          <br>
          R is the red reflectance
          <br>
          The NDVI ranges from -1 to 1. Values close to 1 indicate dense, healthy vegetation, while values close to 0
          indicate no vegetation. Values between 0 and 1 indicate varying degrees of vegetation cover.
        </p>
        <p>
          Negative NDVI values indicate the absence of vegetation. This can be due to a number of factors, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Water: Water bodies such as lakes, rivers, and oceans have negative NDVI values.
          </li>
          <li>
            Snow: Snow-covered areas also have negative NDVI values.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bare soil: Bare soil, such as that found in deserts, also has negative NDVI values.
          </li>
          <li>
            Human-made structures: Human-made structures such as buildings, roads, and parking lots also have negative
            NDVI values.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <br>
          In some cases, negative NDVI values can also be caused by vegetation that is stressed or dying. This can be
          due to factors such as drought, heat stress, or pests.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, negative NDVI values are a good indicator of the absence of vegetation. This information can be used
          to monitor changes in land cover, track the impact of climate change, and identify areas that are at risk of
          desertification or deforestation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The NDVI is a useful tool for monitoring vegetation change over time. It can be used to track deforestation,
          desertification, and other changes in land cover. The NDVI can also be used to assess the impact of climate
          change on vegetation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The NDVI is a powerful tool for understanding the Earth's vegetation. It is a valuable resource for
          scientists, policymakers, and anyone interested in the environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here are some of the applications of NDVI:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Monitoring deforestation and forest degradation
          </li>
          <li>
            Tracking desertification and land degradation
          </li>
          <li>
            Assessing the impact of climate change on vegetation
          </li>
          <li>
            Identifying areas of agricultural productivity
          </li>
          <li>
            Mapping water bodies
          </li>
          <li>
            Monitoring vegetation health
          </li>
          <li>
            Predicting crop yields
          </li>
          <li>
            Assessing the impact of human activities on the environment
            <br>
            &nbsp;
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          NDVI is a powerful tool that can be used to monitor and study a wide range of environmental issues. It is a
          valuable resource for scientists, policymakers, and anyone interested in the Earth's ecosystems.
